## Introduction

In this project, we are trying to deal with an imbalanced classification task by comparing the performance of the classifiers we learn in the course ML01. There are two versions of implementation. You can run our code by following the guideline. 

The dataset we use is the **Physionet's MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset**. Each observation of this dataset contains 186 records of the heart signal during 12 seconds of a person.

You can download the dataset used in this project with https://simonset.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/MT01ProjectData.zip

## How to use notebook

you need to install these two packages to run our code

```
pip install imbalance-learn, scikit-learn
```

## How to start with R

you just need to load the work space and can read our trained information:

In the R console, run

```
load("./RDataFiles/workspace.RData")
```
